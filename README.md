# Checkers-Engine
A checkers engine that uses the Minmax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to find the best move for a given board position. This implementation of the engine also uses Monty-Carlo search to break ties and provide more variation when playing against it. 

The program also accepts two command-line arguments if you wish to have the bot play against itself.
The arguments default to '1 human' where 1 is the search time and human can be either bot or human.
