# Checkers-Engine (Marcher)
This engine uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and a slew of other optimizations to compute the best move for a position. In its current state, it is a
strong player looking ahead quite far with the extended search reaching 30 moves deep. In fact, it is able to tie cake sometimes (cake is a very strong engine for
reference) when it is given time odds of 2:1
and cake is not allowed an end-game table (so only when cake is crippled but hey I'm still happy about this).
