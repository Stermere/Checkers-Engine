# Checkers-Engine
A checkers engine that uses the Minmax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to find the best move for a given board position.

The program also accepts two command-line arguments if you wish to have the bot play against itself.
The arguments default to '1 human' where 1 is the search time and human can be either bot or human.

This branch has the purpose of replacing the evaluation function with a neural network evaluation to improve its positional play.
